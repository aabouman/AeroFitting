# Aerofitting

I did most of the work inside of a Mathematica notebook for speed/ease of changing function forms and datasets and quick animation/plotting.

To view the code/plots you can either open the notebook `DataFitting.nb` in Mathematica or view the notebook exported as a html page in [index.html](https://aabouman.github.io/AeroFitting/).
